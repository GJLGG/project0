            <h1 class='coltitle'>Navigation</h1>

            <p class="colcontent1">At their most basic, navigation skills allow one to choose the correct sequence of trails to follow.
              In situations where a trail or clear line-of-sight to the desired destination is not present, navigation
              and orienteering allow the backpacker to understand the terrain and wilderness around them and,
              using their tools and practices, select the appropriate direction to hike.

            <h1 class='coltitle'>First Aid</h1>

            <p class="colcontent1">Effectively dealing with minor injuries (splinters, punctures, sprains) is considered by many a fundamental backcountry skill.
               More subtle, but maybe even more important, is recognizing and promptly treating hypothermia, heat stroke,
               dehydration and hypoxia, as these are rarely encountered in daily life.

            <h1 class='coltitle'>Survival Skills</h1>

            <p class="colcontent1">Survival skills can provide peace of mind and may make the difference between life and
              death when the weather, terrain, or environment turns unexpectedly for the worse.
