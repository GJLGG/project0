            <li>This is possibly the most important item on this list. You need a sturdy backpack that is the right size.
            The pack size depends on the length of the trip. The number of things you'll need for a week long trip is much
            higher than for a day hike (i.e. a tent).

          </ul>
          <li>Compass and Map</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Two necessary items to navigate.</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Food and Water</li>
          <ul>
            <li>This will also depend on the length of your trip. If you are travelling for multiple days and won't be able to pick up
            any more provisions, you have to plan accordingly. Also be aware that water and food both end up being rather heavy.</li>
