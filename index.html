          <h3 class='coltitle'>What is Backpacking</h3>

          <p class='colcontent'>Backpacking is an outdoor recreation where gear is carried in a backpack.
            This can include food, water, bedding, shelter, clothing, stove, and cooking kit. Weight is necessarily key.
            Backpacking trips range from one night to weeks or months, sometimes aided by planned resupply points or drops.

          <h3 class='coltitle'>What to Consider</h3>

          <p class='colcontent'>When backpacking, you have to consider a few key points. What equipment you need, what locations and climate you'll
          be exploring, what skills you'll need to learn before you start, and what you're looking to get out of the experience. Once you have taken
          all of these variables into account you'll be ready to head out and start backpacking.</p>
